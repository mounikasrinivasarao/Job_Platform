# Project Overview
This project serves as a comprehensive job marketplace where:

Job seekers can create profiles, search and apply for jobs, and track application statuses.
Employers can post job listings, review applicants, and manage the hiring process for their postings.
The application aims to streamline the hiring and application processes for both parties and is ideal for job portals and hiring platforms.
